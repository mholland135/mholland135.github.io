        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <p>
            ---My name is Mason Holland. I was born in Georgia, but quickly moved to 
            California when I was just an infant. I shortly after moved back to 
            Georgia where I spent a few years before moving to Kansas for my dad's 
            job at the FFA. After some time there, I moved back to Georgia with my 
            mom and brother. Since then I've lived in Gwinnett County Georgia.

            ---After moving in with my mom, I have been exploring different hobbies.
            The one that stuck the mopst was programming. I decided that I would do 
            a deep dive into the field with independant studies of things like making 
            bots for discord servers and games using godot. I also took the time to take two years of APCS.
